There are a number of great source control hosting services on the web.</p>
<p>GitHub is probably the best known at this point, but there are a few others worth investigating.</p>
<p>I personally use GitHub for my public, open source projects and BitBucket for my private repos.</p>
<p>A surprising choice for hosting Git is Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Online. What? Microsoft?</p>
<p>Sign of the apocalypse! Cats and dogs, living together!</p>
<p>On the surface Visual Studio Online, or VSO, is a fair clone of BitBucket.</p>
<p>In both cases you get an unlimited number of private repos as long as you have 5 or fewer developers.</p>
<p>Where VSO becomes <em>very</em> interesting is when you look <strong>beyond</strong> source control at its other offerings.</p>
<p>First of all you get project management help complete with bug tracking and Kanban boards.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting, however is the build server.</p>
<p>I should say <em>build service</em> since it let&#39;s you run your builds on pre-built virtual machines in a pool <strong>you don&#39;t have to manage</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve worked with the older, XAML based build configurations from Microsoft, you are probably skeptical. Well, skeptical and possibly scarred.</p>
<p>I always found that build system to be an abomination, so I wasn&#39;t super optimistic when I heard about the new version.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been several months since the Build conference, but I finally watched the video linked at the top of the post.</p>
<p><strong>Wow!</strong></p>
<p>Not only is the new build system composed of sensible text files instead of chopped up and hidden behind a myriad of dialogs, you can actually build more than just .Net apps!</p>
<p>Now you can build anything from Java apps, to Node.js apps, to fricken&#39; IOS apps!</p>
<p>Well, to be fair you can&#39;t build IOS apps on a Windows VM, but you can link out from the build system to trigger build steps on a Mac. At least they say you can. I don&#39;t have a Mac, so I can&#39;t prove it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent some time over the past few days setting up a build for work in VSO, and I&#39;m impressed enough that I&#39;m considering moving some of my Git repos from BitBucket to VSO.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t promise you&#39;ll be as impressed as I have been (I am easily entertained, after all), but I do recommend you check out what Microsoft has to offer. For personal projects with fewer than 5 developers it&#39;s free, so check it out!</p>
